# Customer Churn Prediction

## Problem statement:   
Businesses, particularly subscription-based services like telecom companies, face a significant challenge in retaining customers. Customer churn (the rate at which customers stop using a service) directly impacts a company's revenue and growth. Therefore, predicting which customers are likely to churn is crucial for taking proactive measures to retain them.

This project focuses on analyzing customer data (e.g., demographic, service usage, billing details) and building a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will churn or not. By identifying potential churners, the business can implement targeted retention strategies, such as offering discounts, improving customer service, or providing tailored offers.
